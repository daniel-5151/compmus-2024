The corpus of consists of two playlists: 
- Rock tracks from artists based on the East Coast
- Rock tracks from artists based on the West Coast

East Coast rock is often thought of as being more energetic and fast-paced, which is based on big city life. On the other hand, West Coast music is often thought of being more laid-back and are thus considered more relaxing. I wanted to put these assumptions to the test by comparing the tempos of the rock music from both regions. This was done with a boxplot, since it gives a nice and compact summary of the distribution while also showing the outliers. As can be seen in the plot, it does seem like West Coast rock does indeed have an overall slower tempo. This difference, however, is not as big as I thought is would be beforehand. What I also found interesting is that West Coast rock does have a bigger variance than the East Coast. I expected it to be the other way, since the East Coast has more metropolotan areas and would thus expect more variety.
